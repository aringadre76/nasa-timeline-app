PRD: This Day in Space Timeline App
1. Overview

The This Day in Space Timeline App is a web application that showcases historical NASA images tied to specific dates. Users can explore a scrollable, visually rich timeline (similar to Instagram stories or a vertical feed) populated with NASA’s image archive. Each entry includes image metadata (date, mission, description) and optional contextual links (e.g., Wikipedia articles about missions).

The app highlights engineering skills in API integration, time-series visualization, UI/UX design, and external data enrichment.

2. Goals & Success Metrics
Goals

Provide an interactive way to explore NASA’s historical image archive.

Demonstrate strong software engineering: clean architecture, API integration, responsive UI.

Deliver an engaging user experience that feels modern (timeline/story-like interface).

Success Metrics

✅ Smooth infinite scrolling timeline with fast image loads.

✅ Users can search by date or browse “random day in history.”

✅ Metadata displayed clearly (mission name, photographer, date, description).

✅ (Stretch) Contextual Wikipedia links enrich each entry.

✅ (Stretch) Shareable links (e.g., “Check out what happened on Aug 24 in space history”).

3. Target Users

Space enthusiasts looking for a fun, educational browsing experience.

General audience curious about historical events tied to specific dates.

Recruiters/portfolio reviewers (showcasing SWE skills).

4. Core Features
MVP

Date Picker

Users select a specific date (e.g., August 24).

App fetches images released on that date (any year).

Scrollable Timeline

Vertical, card-style timeline (similar to Instagram stories/Twitter feed).

Each card includes:

NASA image

Title & description

Date taken/released

Mission tag (if available)

NASA API Integration

Use images.nasa.gov API
.

Query by date & keywords.

Responsive UI

Works on desktop and mobile.

Clean, minimal styling (dark mode default).

Stretch Features

Wikipedia API Integration

For each mission tag, auto-fetch related Wikipedia summary.

Display as expandable context below image card.

Random Day Button

Show events for a random date.

User Sharing

Generate shareable link: thisdayinspace.app/08-24.

Favorites

Authenticated users can save favorite images.

Animations/Transitions

Smooth fade/slide when switching dates.

5. Technical Requirements
Frontend

Framework: React (Next.js recommended for SEO + SSR).

Styling: TailwindCSS for responsive design.

Visualization: Timeline layout with scrollable cards.

State Mgmt: React Query / Redux for caching NASA API calls.

Backend (Optional for MVP)

Not strictly required (API is public).

Backend could be added for:

Caching results (Redis/Postgres).

User auth & favorites.

APIs

NASA Image Library API (core).

Wikipedia API (stretch).

Hosting

Frontend: Vercel or Netlify.

Backend (if needed): Render/Heroku.

6. User Flows

Flow 1: Explore a Date

User opens app → sees default today’s date.

Timeline shows NASA images taken/released on this day in past years.

User scrolls → images load with metadata.

Flow 2: Change Date

User opens date picker.

Selects a new date.

Timeline reloads with images for that date.

Flow 3: Enrich Context (Stretch)

User clicks “See Mission Context.”

Wikipedia summary expands inline under image card.

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Images lazy-loaded (avoid long waits).

Accessibility: High-contrast mode, keyboard navigable.

Scalability: Should handle ~10k daily users without backend caching.

SEO: Each date page should be shareable & crawlable.

8. Future Extensions

Mobile app (React Native) with push notifications: “Today in Space History.”

Gamification: Quiz mode (“Which mission is this from?”).

AI summaries of daily events.
